Creating a CI/CD (Continuous integration/Continuous deployment) pipeline for your open source GitHub project is easy & free!

----

# Step 1 - Login to Travis CI with Github

Step one is super easy! Just go to [https://travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org) and sign in with your GitHub account.

# Step 2 - Enable Travis CI for your repository

Look in the list of repositories and flip the switch for whatever repository you want to build a CI/CD pipeline for!

<img src={Repos} alt="Travis CI repos" />

### Note: If you don't see your repository here, make sure it is a public repository. Travis CI is NOT free for private repositories.

# Step 3 - Create an IAM user in AWS

- Login to AWS and navigate to IAM and click on the Users option in the menu on the left.
- Click "Add User"
- Name the user something to the effect of `travis-s3`
- Choose "Programmatic Access"
- Assign permissions

<img src={AttachExisting} alt="Attach existing policy" />

Choose "Attach existing policies directly".

Search for "s3" and choose "AmazonS3FullAccess"

<img src={S3FullAccess} alt="AWS S3 full access" />

This policiy might have a little more than we need, but you can always go back and do more fine grained permissions later.

Click next.

Here you can assign tags to the user, you can skip this step if you want.

Click Review.

Make sure everything looks correct on this screen. The user should have a single permission called `AmazonS3FullAccess`

<img src={Review} alt="User review" />

Click "Create user"

Your user is created!

<img src={Created} alt="User created" />

### Before moving on, copy the `Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Key`. This is the last opportunity you will get to see the secret access key.

# Step 4 - Create your pipeline

### Disclaimer: Since I recently did a post about how to host your React site on AWS S3 for virtually no cost, I will be going over the deployment process for that stack.

### Create a .travis.yml file

This file should be in the root of your project.

This is just the base travis file. All we are doing here is setting up some prerequisits that we have for building our project.

```yaml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "13"
branches:
  only:
  - master
cache:
  yarn: true
install:
- yarn install
script: yarn build
```

----

### Add S3 deploy

This tells Travis what to do with our code once it is done compiling.

Make sure to replace `blog.kalob.net` with your bucket name and `Porterk/kalob.net-blog` with your `username/repository` from GitHub

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: s3
  access_key_id: <ACCESS_KEY>
  secret_access_key: <SECRET_KEY>
  bucket: blog.kalob.net
  skip_cleanup: true
  local-dir: build
  acl: public_read
  region: us-east-2
  on:
    repo: PorterK/kalob.net-blog
```

----

### Isn't it insecure to have my S3 secret in my repository?

Yes, very. Let's fix that.

You can run `travis encrypt --add deploy.secret_access_key` as described [here](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/s3/).

### Note: you must install the [travis cli](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#readme) in order for this to work.

You should see your secret key replaced with this:

```yaml
secret_access_key:
  secure: ...
```

---

### After the deploy, invalidate CloudFront

In order to get this working, you wan to use the `after_deploy` option:

```yaml
after_deploy:
  - travis-ci-cloudfront-invalidation -a $AWS_CLOUDFRONT_ACCESS_KEY -s $AWS_CLOUDFRONT_SECRET -c $AWS_CLOUDFRONT_DIST_ID -i '/*' -b $TRAVIS_BRANCH -p $TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST
```

Also, under `install` add:

```
- yarn global add travis-ci-cloudfront-invalidation
```

We will need to add `AWS_CLOUDFRONT_ACCESS_KEY` `AWS_CLOUDFRONT_SECRET` and `AWS_CLOUDFRONT_DIST_ID` as environment variables in Travis.

For this step, you should follow Step 3 to create another user, but choose `CloudFrontFullAccess` for the permission set.

In the Travis dashboard, click on settings, and look for this:

<img src={EnvVars} alt="Environment variables entry in Travis dashboard" />

Fill out the environment variables. You can find your CloudFront distribution ID in the CloudFront console.

Your final YAML file should look something like this:

```yaml
language: node_js
sudo: required
node_js:
- '13'
branches:
  only:
  - master
cache:
  yarn: true
install:
- yarn global add travis-ci-cloudfront-invalidation
- yarn install
script: yarn build
deploy:
  provider: s3
  access_key_id: xxx
  secret_access_key:
    secure: xxx
  bucket: kalob.net-blog
  skip_cleanup: true
  local-dir: build
  acl: public_read
  region: us-east-2
  on:
    repo: PorterK/kalob.net-blog
after_deploy:
- travis-ci-cloudfront-invalidation -a $AWS_CLOUDFRONT_ACCESS_KEY -s $AWS_CLOUDFRONT_SECRET -c $AWS_CLOUDFRONT_DIST_ID -i '/*' -b $TRAVIS_BRANCH -p $TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST

```

----

# Step 5 - Done!

Push your code up to `master` and watch the build take place!

Travis CI builds usually take a few seconds to startup, so don't worry if it takes a second.
