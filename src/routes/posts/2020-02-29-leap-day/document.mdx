I yeeted my old ghost blog straight off of the internet.

After yelling "THIS IS SPARTA", I *may have* deleted the database containing all of my previous blog posts. It is uncofirmed whether or not the 2 actions are related.

Despite my best*ish* efforts to port over old blog posts, we (*I*) have to start over...

brand new...

This means there are no rules. The only limits are-- there are no limits.

so without a further ado...

after much anticipation...

here it is...
