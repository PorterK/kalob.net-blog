For the last 6 months I've been helping [Lumatic](https://lumaticimagery.com) work on their web platform. After adjusting some of
the dev processes, switching them from an internally managed Kubernetes cluster to EKS, I spent some time looking at how the user
experience could be futher optimized. The setup I landed on ended up making load times up to 10x faster (further analysis later).

## The Problem

[Lumatic](https://lumaticimagery.com) is all about photos - they offer services to make every part of photography easier & better
for a wide range of businesses and groups. At the core of this mission is an image hosting platform where users can view their
photos.

At Lumatic we've always used signed S3 URLs to view photos securely stored in the various buckets from which we serve photos. Due to some
of the specific security concerns at Lumatic, we only give the users a URL that's valid for anywhere between 5 minutes and an hour. It's
worth mentioning that we didn't have any form of cacheing at this point on those URLs, so each request is a new URL at this point.

The problem now presents itself - galleries with lots of photos take a long time to load directly from S3. As the platform grew,
even galleries with a few photos started to take a long time to load.

## The Solution

My initial thought was to start doing the easiest & most obvious thing - the S3 URLs weren't cacheing in the browser level
cache because the URL changes every time; we should start to resend the same URLs for each request within a specific window.

While that seems practical there are several issues with it:

- Users who caught the end of the window would pontentially see broken images if the actual image wasn't rendered before the link
expired.
- We would have to implement a system to re-use photo URLs which would add at least 1 more hop to the request to see a gallery
- Browser level cache would still be busted after the window to view a photo has passed, so this solution only really helps a user
who is clicking between galleries in a single session.

Signed cookies to the rescue!

I knew from the onset that I wanted to introduce a CDN to the equasion to improve compression and speed to parts of the US outside
of our S3 region. I've been in some projects recently that use Fastly, which has some amazing features for image serving built in
but implementing the security piece. However, images only being a available from sessions we authenticate wasn't straight forward. Due
to this & some other things I decided against using Fastly. I ended up going with [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/), which has an awesome feature for this
specific use case: signed cookies.

## Implementing CloudFront Signed Cookies

Implementing Signed Cookies is pretty straight forward on the server side, after setting up the CloudFront bucket. Although I
didn't want to setup [Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/) at this time, I followed
[this article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/signed-cookie-based-authentication-with-amazon-cloudfront-and-aws-lambdaedge-part-1-authentication/)
to setup the CloudFront distribution.

After the distribution is setup, the code on the server side is pretty simple. The AWS SDK has a built in method to do it:

```js
const signer = AWS.CloudFront.Signer(
  process.env.CLOUDFRONT_SIGNER_NAME,
  process.env.CLOUDFRONT_SIGNER_KEY
);

const cookies = signer.getSignedCookie({
  policy: JSON.stringify({
    Statement: [
      {
        Resource: `${process.env.CLOUDFRONT_URL}/*`,
        Condition: { DateLessThan: { 'AWS:EpochTime': Date.now() + (1 * Days) } },
      },
    ],
  }),
);

Object.entries(cookies).map(([cookieName, cookieValue]) =>
  res.header('Set-Cookie', `${cookieName}=${cookieValue}; Path=/; Domain=.domain.com; Secure; HttpOnly`)
);
```

With the above code, you're done! If you do this, then send the link from the [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) distribution you're all done!

On the client it was pretty easy - we use [axios](https://axios-http.com/) to make all of the client requests, so all we had to do
was add `withCredentials: true`.

And then just like that we have signed cookies!

*Except* for a few caveats:

- In order to get this to work properly you have to assign the cookie from the same domain as the [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) distribution
- Meaning, in a normal environment you should setup a custom domain & add it as a CNAME in [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
- In order for the browser to actually set the cookie, you have to also recieve the cookie on the same domain it is sent from

The last point presents an interesting issue - we usually use `localhost` for development. How are we going to be able to work
locally?

## Setting up the local environment

[MKCert](https://mkcert.org/) will create a local CA & allow us to issue ourselves a certificate for local development. All we
need to do then is update `/etc/hosts` to point our domain at localhost & update the project to use our certificates.

In order to make this easy I wrote a script that puts the SSL cert in a known location `~/.lumatic/cert` on each
machine so that I can update the locally running [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) instance and [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)
to use the certificates we just generated.

While I can't share the exact script I wrote, I hope the findings here saves someone else in the future - I wasn't fully aware of
exactly how locked down browsers are in regards to cookies. Having read some documentation in the past I knew `SameSite` was a cookie
option, but if it has a use this isn't it. If you set `SameSite=true` most modern browsers will just block the cookies.
